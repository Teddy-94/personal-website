    "I enjoy coding in the fantastic open source, community driven editor NeoVim, which is a modernization of the editor Vim. I have spent quite some time tinkering with the configuration to find something that I really enjoy using, and since it is very much a 'build your own editor' experience, it is also an ever evolving code base. I have made an effort to keep the configuration files as clean as possible, and to use as few plugins I can manage.",

I have spent quite some time tinkering with the configuration to find something that I really enjoy using, and since it is very much a 'build your own editor' experience, it is also an ever evolving codebase. I have made an effort to keep the configuration files as clean as possible, and to use as few plugins I can manage. The current configuration is well below 200 loc, and uses only a few core plugins to make the experience as 'IDE-like' as possible."
